# Minecraft-Pack-of-Charcoal
A simple mod to add a pack of charcoal item and its recipe to Minecraft.

To craft a pack of charcoal, put four charcoal in a 2x2 square on a crafting grid.
A single pack of charcoal can be used to craft four charcoal, allowing for bulk storage of charcoal.

A pack of charcoal can be used as fuel for smelting.
A single pack of charcoal will smelt 32 items, equal to the four charcoal used to make it with no added efficiency.
